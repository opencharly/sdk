// host exhausts the retries and fails loudly (never an infinite retry). NOT retry-on-flake
// (R4): only an infra INTERRUPTION (never-completed probe) is re-run — a probe that RAN and
// returned a real exit is authoritative and never retried here.

// RunWithEventually wraps a per-check verb handler in a retry loop when the check declares
// `eventually: <duration>`. The handler is called with no arguments — it closes over the
// check, runner, and context.
//
// Semantics:
//
//   - eventually:  outer retry cap (parsed as time.Duration). Defaults the returned
//     CheckResult to Attempts=1 when unset (handler runs exactly once, unchanged).
//   - retry_interval: sleep between retries. Defaults to 1s. Must be ≤ eventually or the
//     loop would sleep past the deadline on the first miss.
//   - PASS semantics: the FIRST attempt that returns StatusPass wins; its
//     stdout/captures/message are what propagate.
//   - FAIL semantics: the LAST attempt before deadline is returned, ensuring authors see the
//     most recent failure detail rather than a stale first-attempt error.
//   - SKIP semantics: treated the same as FAIL for retry purposes — skips aren't actionable
//     to retry against.
//
// Variable expansion: the handler re-runs from the same expanded check each attempt. The
// caller must expand variables BEFORE calling RunWithEventually — re-expansion per attempt
// would re-evaluate ${CAPTURED:name} mid-run, which is unwanted (captures record on PASS
// only, and pre-pass attempts wouldn't see their own future capture).
//
// Context: RunWithEventually honours ctx.Deadline / ctx.Done — a canceled context
// short-circuits the loop with the last attempt's result.

		// probe that RAN and failed is NOT retried here (that is the author's `eventually:`).
		// NOTE (R44): a podman container-SETUP infra failure is deliberately NOT retried —
		// Option A (the persistent-container box-mode) removes the O(N) setup contention at
