// TestLowerMapsTheLobsterVocabulary pins opencharly/plugin-pipeline#38 at the boundary where it went
// wrong. The authored schema and the engine's schema use different words for the same idea, and nothing
// in the lowering translated them: an authored `on_error: fail` — a word the schema explicitly offers —
// reached an engine whose enum accepts only `stop`, and silently behaved as `continue`. A second, quieter
// instance: `wait` carries a DEFAULT on the authored side and none on the engine's, so an unauthored
// `wait:` arrived empty against an enum with nothing to fall back to.
